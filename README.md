# stuff to get done
  - analysis package
    - need a series of functions to analyze the output of the backmapping workflow at each step
      - g(r)
      - bond length
      - dihedral angles
      - bond angles
  - write_backmapping protocol
    - need to pattern out how the current bashmap.sh and in. files on talapas work
