# backmapping
wello and helcome!
i calculated about how long this would take me, but boy am i bad at math =>
now go home

# stuff to get done
  - analysis package
    - need a series of functions to analyze the output of the backmapping workflow at each step
      - g(r)
      - dihedral angles
      - bond angles
  - write_backmapping protocol
    - need to pattern out how the current bashmap.sh and in. files on talapas work
    and organize around that

loook for nvt of atomistic 

iniital coordinates should be fforom the CG data

temperature, density, 

IECG potential

pressure subroutine should have the correct potential

run MsD.pbs 

(eliminate the soft)
